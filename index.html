<h1>antifest, home of the world's freest festival.</h1>
<p>This year has come and gone and we have finally recovered from the process.  We have already started working on next year&rsquo;s festivities and are happy to report that this year&rsquo;s successes and failures have given us a lot of ideas.</p>
<h2>site expansion project</h2>
<p>One of our first goals for this year is to expand the website and make it the hub for dispensing all antifest information and communications, so stay tuned to this independent station for all your antifest propaganda!</p>
